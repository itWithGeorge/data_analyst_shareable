## ðŸ‘¤ Summary
As a **certified data analyst (Microsoft & Google)**, my experience with dataâ€‘driven decision making spans both business and engineering. Trained as an **economist**, I began with the essentialsâ€”**Excelâ€‘based analysis and PowerPoint storytelling**â€”to:
- track sales across **100+ points of sale (POS)**,
- analyze **industryâ€‘level output** from automotive to wood manufacturing, and
- oversee **~1,000 projects** with a total net budget of more than 60 billion forints, surfacing early signals that required **immediate action**.

Since **2017**, working as a **software developer**, my toolkit expanded to build **endâ€‘toâ€‘end data pipelines** and dashboards that go beyond descriptive/diagnostic views and into **predictive analysis**. Iâ€™ve delivered **industryâ€‘grade ingestion pipelines** and taken broader responsibility across the data lifecycle. In one project, I scoped multiâ€‘company data processing and built a **custom analytics pipeline with bespoke visualizations on GCP**â€”a viable alternative to **GA4**.

> This portfolio includes **examâ€‘practice** builds and **sideâ€‘project** demos ONLY that reflect my approach to clarity, speed, and decision impact.
