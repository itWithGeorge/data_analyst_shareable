## 📝 Description
A **polished, professional** take on executive storytelling, built in **Power BI** on **Excel** data during a Microsoft certified data analyst exam scenario. This version emphasizes **board‑ready clarity**, **visual consistency**, and **sensible interactivity** (year/quarter slicers, regional map) so leaders can make **fast, confident decisions**.

**What’s improved vs the base exam build**
- **Sharper KPI design:** clean typography, consistent units/precision, compact card layout.
- **Clear comparisons:** YoY % and prior‑year context sit next to totals to reduce mental math.
- **Guided flow:** a left‑to‑right narrative from KPIs → trends → mix → accountability (salespeople) → geography.
- **Design system:** restrained color palette, consistent baselines, grid alignment, minimal chartjunk.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Power BI Desktop** (star model, DAX measures, formatting, bookmarks)
- **Microsoft Excel** (source data)
- *(Optional)* **Power BI Service** / **OneLake** (publishing, access, scheduled refresh)

## 📊 Featured Visuals
- **Executive KPI Cards**
  - *Total Sales*, *Total Sales YoY%*, *Profit*, *Profit Margin* — immediate business health snapshot.
- **Sales by Year / Quarter**
  - *Clustered columns* by Year with **Quarter slicer** for seasonality; useful for target/actual reviews.
- **Year‑over‑Year Growth**
  - *Line/column* YoY% to spotlight momentum shifts and inflection points.
- **Category Composition**
  - *Stacked / 100% stacked bar* showing revenue mix (e.g., **Bikes** as dominant category), exposing concentration risk.
- **Salesperson Leaderboard**
  - *Horizontal bars* ranking reps by sales; identify top performers and coaching opportunities.
- **Sales by Quantity (Small Multiples)**
  - Per‑category trend (Bikes, Components, Clothing, Accessories) to connect volume with revenue.
- **Total Sales by Region (Map)**
  - *Azure Maps* visual for regional distribution and whitespace discovery.

> 💡 **Why this serves decision‑making**  
> - **Context** (YoY & PY) converts snapshots into **signals**.  
> - **Hierarchy** (KPIs → trend → mix → accountability → region) mirrors how execs think.  
> - **Clarity** (labels, scales, decimals) reduces cognitive load and speeds action.

## 📐 Design choices (professional polish)
- **Typography & spacing:** consistent card sizing, readable number formats (K/M), and aligned axes.
- **Color semantics:** categories use stable hues; alerts rely on saturation rather than noisy reds.
- **Interaction:** slicers limited to **Year** and **Quarter**; no competing filters.
- **Annotation:** brief callouts for YoY swings and category spikes; avoid dense text blocks.
