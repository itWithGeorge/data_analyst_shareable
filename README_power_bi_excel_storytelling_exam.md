## 📝 Description
A concise, **decision‑support dashboard** created during a **Microsoft Certified Data Analyst** exam scenario. Built with **Power BI** on top of an **Excel** dataset, it demonstrates how effective visual storytelling can guide decisions by surfacing the right KPIs, providing clear context (prior‑year comparisons), and highlighting **meaningful year‑over‑year (YoY) changes**. The design focuses on **clarity, digestibility, and actionability** for non‑technical stakeholders.

**Scope highlights**
- **Executive KPIs:** Revenue, Profit, Profit Margin, Revenue YoY% (single‑glance health check).
- **Trend vs Prior Year:** Revenue vs **Prior Year (PY)** to frame growth in context.
- **YoY Growth:** Dedicated YoY visual to quickly spot inflection points.
- **Narrative Callouts:** A "Key findings" text panel summarizing the story for fast consumption.
- **Presentation‑ready:** Clean typography, consistent scales, and minimal chartjunk for board visibility.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Power BI Desktop** (modeling, measures, visuals, annotations)
- **Microsoft Excel** (source data)
- *(Optional in production)* **Power BI Service** / **OneLake** (publishing, access control, refresh)

## 📊 Featured Visuals
- **Revenue vs Revenue PY**
  - *Clustered column* comparison of **Revenue** by **Year** with a prior‑year reference to reveal trend and base effects.
- **Year‑over‑Year Growth**
  - *Line/column* view of **Revenue YoY%** across years to spotlight growth/decline periods.
- **Executive KPI Cards**
  - *Cards* for **Revenue**, **Profit**, **Profit Margin**, and **Revenue YoY%** for a quick status read.
- **Key Findings (Narrative)**
  - *Text annotations* capturing the main takeaways (e.g., standout growth year, decline year, thin margins) so decision‑makers can act fast.

> 💡 **Why this works for decision‑making**
> - **Context** (PY comparison) turns standalone numbers into **interpretable signals**.
> - **YoY focus** highlights **direction and momentum**, not just totals.
> - **Executive cards** reduce cognitive load; the narrative panel aligns the team on the same story.
